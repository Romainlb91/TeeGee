TeeGee is a text generator that will generate through a particular simplified
syntax, HTML. 

This generator use ObjectMacro2

The lexer and parser are built using sablecc-4-beta.2.

HOW TO COMPILE
==============

In order to compile TeeGee, you must first compile the grammar files and the 
ObjectMacro files.

java -jar path-to-sablecc-4-beta.2/lib/sablecc.jar -d src -p mino grammar/mino.sablecc

java -jar path-to-objectmacro.jar -d path-to-TeeGee/intermediate/ path-to-TeeGee/html.objectmacro
java -jar path-to-objectmacro-back.jar -d path-to-TeeGee/src/ -p teegee.macro path-to-html.intermediate 

Once this is done, you can compile the java files and give the folder you
want to generate, in the src/ directory, as you would normally.

On Windows, replace all the "/" above by "\".

Have fun!
